# Welcome

Hello :)
It is a boilerplate to use for future projects starting.
I will try to cover up as much as i can to make it easy to re-adjust.
If you have some comments or you want to work on it with me just write to me :)

# Manual

1. Enter 'yarn install' (if you are using latest node version webpack will throw warnings -> downgrade to i.e. n v8, #webpack2020shaming)
2. Now you have few possibilities:

   - yarn start - starts the development server (using webpack, no hot module added so you have to refresh after changes - i don't see this as a problem for now)
   - yarn build - bundles the app into static production build in './dist' directory

# TODO

1. Build core project body using installed libraries
2. Add some testing library with manual 4 usage (jest?) + script for testing in package.json
3. Read about manifest.json and robots.txt and decide do i need to use them in project
4. Provide css feature-detection for styles that will be written (i home that babel + webpack cares about js stubbing)
5. Adjust boilerplate to WCAG as much as you could
