# Manual

0. Install make and nodejs && create `.env` file in root project directory with defined API adress that you want to ask
1. Enter `make install` (if you are using latest node version webpack will throw warnings - ignore them)
2. Now you have few possibilities:

   - make start - starts the development server (using webpack, no hot module added so you have to refresh after changes - I don't see this as a problem for now, https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader if u need to have it)
   - make build - bundles the app into static production build in './dist' directory
